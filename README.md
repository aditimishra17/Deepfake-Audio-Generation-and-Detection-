# Deepfake-Audio-Generation-and-Detection-
Developed a deepfake audio pipeline using state-of-the-art neural architectures to both synthesize and detect synthetic speech. Utilized Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow for generating high-quality audio from text, and built a CNN-based classifier for detecting fake audio with 85% accuracy. Employed advanced audio features like MFCCs and spectrograms, and implemented data preprocessing to reduce false positives. The project demonstrates a complete cycle of deepfake audio creation and defense â€” applicable in voice authentication, media forensics, and AI ethics research.
